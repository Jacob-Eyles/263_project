Contamination of the Onehunga aquifer

Due to the recent drought, Watercare, the Auckland Council Organisation that manages “three waters” (drinking, storm, waste) in the city, are 
investigating the feasibility of additional extraction from the Onehunga Aquifer.

However, recent surveys indicate that levels of dissolved copper are increasing, likely due to pressure decline exceeding a threshold at which 
leaching from a nearby fertiliser manufacturer started to occur. This creates a health risk , as increased copper concentration levels in the 
water may turn the water toxic (maximum safe threshold for copper is 2mg/L). There are also environmental effects, with the elevated copper 
levels turning oyster beds in the Manakau Harbour green.

This project has the purpose of forecasting the effects on the copper concentration and pressure of the aquifer from the various extraction rates, 
while taking into account the uncertainty of the data.The extraction rates forecasted will be the increased consent to 40 million litres per day, 
current extraction of 20 million litres per day, decreased extraction of 15,10 and 5 million litres per day respectively, and halting all extraction.
